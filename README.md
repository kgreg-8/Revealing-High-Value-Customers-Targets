_**Bolded** text highlights the most valuable attribute values._



The most valuable customers are classified as ‘Platinum’ profiles based on the RFM Analysis. There are 798 platinum customers out of 3,416 total customers, generating 29% of total profit ($11.05M). These high-value customers currently are between 31-50 years old, making up 52% of total profit. Across all relevant age ranges (11-70 - age ranges that have a profit relevance greater than 1%) customers classified in the ‘Mass’ wealth segment generate between 47.5%-54% of total profit. Further, of the 12 job categories in the data, the top 3, in no specific order and in terms of profitability, for each relevant age group are Manufacturing, Financial Services, and Health. 

Looking at product data, the majority of profit comes from the Standard product line and the WeareA2B, Solex and Trek brands. The brands in the heatmap on the dashboard are in order of average profit margin, from WeareA2B (highest) to Norco (lowest):

Hence, it is recommended to encourage customers to buy products from the WeareA2B, Solex, Trek and OHM brands to maximize profit.
